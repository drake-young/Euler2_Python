# Euler2_Python

Problem 2 of Project Euler solved using two separate approaches in Python3. One of the approaches uses the sequential computation of the Fibonacci sequence Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2). The other method uses the closed-form formula for computing the fibonacci sequence.

## Project Euler Problem 2 -- Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
